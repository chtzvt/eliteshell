# EliteShell!

[EliteShell](https://www.reddit.com/r/eliteshell) is a cool theme based on the theme used by [/r/nameaserver](https://www.reddit.com/r/nameaserver). It's an awesome, minimal, easy to use, customisable, and generally really cool looking theme for your subreddit with a large focus on text. While it's is made primarily for subreddits involving computers, it can be used just about anywhere you want a cool "homebrew" look.

If you're using Elite Shell in your subreddit, please [make a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eliteshell/submit?title=/r/YourSub%20is%20using%20EliteShell!) and tell me about it! I love to see how ES is being used.

## Installation

1. Download the images ([sprites.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctrezevant/eliteshell/master/sprites.png), [blank.png](https://raw.github.com/ggppjj/eliteshell/blob/master/blank.png) and [expando.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctrezevant/eliteshell/master/expando.png)) and upload them to your subreddit's stylesheet page, without changing the filenames.

2. Simply copy the contents of the [CSS file](https://github.com/ctrezevant/eliteshell/blob/master/eliteshell.css) into the relevant box on your subreddit's stylesheet page.

3. It's that simple! Enjoy EliteShell!
